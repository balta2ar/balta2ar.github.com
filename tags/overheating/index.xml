Setting up nvidia drivers har been historically a huge pain, and after
one of the updates few months ago, one of the side effects was that
any moderate CPU load would cause the fans to go full blast. Besides
of reaching nearly 100 degrees Celsius, the noise was unbearable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried attacking the problem several times, but to no avail. Recently,
I tried one more time, and this time I managed to reduce the fan noise and
the max temperature to consistent 70 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
