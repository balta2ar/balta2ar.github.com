Usually, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them used for range queries, but they can also be used for
finding overlapping intervals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When applied to the problem of answering range queries (e.g. sum on an interval),
the key idea with segment trees is to split the problem space into smaller parts
during preprocessing, so that during query we can visit only a small part of the
problem space. Exactly the same idea is used for finding overlapping intervals.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
