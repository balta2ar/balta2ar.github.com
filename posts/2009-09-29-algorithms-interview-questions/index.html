Это был один
из немногих курсов, в котором мне понравилось абсолютно всё: прекрасная
подача материала (лектор — сам Седжвик), наглядные слайды, наличие
сопутствующей курсу книги, из которой можно почерпнуть больше подробностей
по теме, нетривиальные домашние задания и, наконец, вопросы для интервью.</p><p>Я первый раз вижу, чтобы в курсе давали примеры таких вопросов. Это
отличное подспорье для подготовки к собеседованиям, и поэтому я хочу
поделиться ими здесь.</p><h2 id=union-find>Union-Find</h2><h3 id=question-1-social-network-connectivity>Question 1 Social network connectivity</h3><p>Given a social network containing N members and a log file containing M
timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an
algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are
connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend … of a
friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that
friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm
should be MlogN or better and use extra space proportional to N.</p><p>Hint: union-find.</p><h3 id=question-2-union-find-with-specific-canonical-element>Question 2 Union-find with specific canonical element</h3><p>Add a method find() to the union-find data type so that find(i) returns
the largest element in the connected component containing i. The
operations, union(), connected(), and find() should all take logarithmic
time or better.</p><p>For example, if one of the connected components is {1,2,6,9}, then the
find() method should return 9 for each of the four elements in the
connected components.</p><p>Hint: maintain an extra array to the weighted quick-union data structure
that stores for each root i the large element in the connected component
containing i.</p><h3 id=question-3-successor-with-delete>Question 3 Successor with delete</h3><p>Given a set of N integers S={0,1,&mldr;,N−1} and a sequence of requests of
the following form:</p><ul><li>Remove x from S</li><li>Find the successor of x: the smallest y in S such that y ≥ x.</li></ul><p>design a data type so that all operations (except construction) should
take logarithmic time or better.</p><p>Hint: use the modification of the union-find data discussed in the
previous question.</p><h3 id=question-4-union-by-size>Question 4 Union-by-size</h3><p>Develop a union-find implementation that uses the same basic strategy as
weighted quick-union but keeps track of tree height and always links the
shorter tree to the taller one. Prove a lgN upper bound on the height of
the trees for N sites with your algorithm.</p><p>Hint: replace the sz[] array with a ht[] array such that ht[i] stores the
height of the subtree rooted at i.</p><h2 id=analysis-of-algorithms>Analysis of Algorithms</h2><h3 id=question-1-3-sum-in-quadratic-time>Question 1 3-SUM in quadratic time</h3><p>Design an algorithm for the 3-SUM problem that takes time proportional to
N² in the worst case. You may assume that you can sort the N integers in
time proportional to N² or better.</p><p>[ ] Hint</p><p>given an integer x and a sorted array a[] of N distinct integers, design a
linear-time algorithm to determine if there exists two distinct indices i
and j such that a[i] + a[j] == x.</p><h3 id=question-2-search-in-a-bitonic-array>Question 2 Search in a bitonic array</h3><p>An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of
integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write
a program that, given a bitonic array of N distinct integer values,
determines whether a given integer is in the array. Standard version: Use
∼3lgN compares in the worst case. Signing bonus: Use ∼2lgN compares in the
worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer
than ∼2lgN compares in the worst case).</p><p>Hints: Standard version. First, find the maximum integer using ∼1lgN
compares — this divides the array into the increasing and decreasing
pieces. Signing bonus. Do it without finding the maximum integer.</p><h3 id=question-3-egg-drop>Question 3 Egg drop</h3><p>Suppose that you have an N-story building and plenty of eggs. An egg
breaks if it is dropped from floor T or higher and does not break
otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of T
given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:</p><ul><li>Version 0: 1 egg, ≤ T tosses.</li><li>Version 1: ∼1lgN eggs and ∼1lgN tosses.</li><li>Version 2: ∼lgT eggs and ∼2lgT tosses.</li><li>Version 3: 2 eggs and ∼2 sqrt(N) tosses.</li><li>Version 4: 2 eggs and ≤ c sqrt(T) tosses for some fixed constant c.</li></ul><p>Hints:</p><ul><li>Version 0: sequential search.</li><li>Version 1: binary search.</li><li>Version 2: find an interval containing T of size ≤2T, then do binary
search.</li><li>Version 3: find an interval of size sqrt(N), then do sequential
search.</li></ul><p>Note: can be improved to ∼sqrt(2N) tosses.</p><ul><li>Version 4: 1 + 2 + 3 + &mldr; + t ∼ 1/2 t².

constant amortized number of stack operations.</p><p>Hint: If you push elements onto a stack and then pop them all, they appear
in reverse order. If you repeat this process, they are now back in order.</p><h3 id=question-2-stack-with-max>Question 2 Stack with max</h3><p>Create a data structure that efficiently supports the stack operations
(push and pop) and also a return-the-maximum operation. Assume the
elements are reals numbers so that you can compare them.</p><p>Hint: Use two stacks, one to store all of the items and a second stack to
store the maximums.</p><h3 id=question-3-java-generics>Question 3 Java generics</h3><p>Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation.</p><p>Hint: to start, you need to understand that Java arrays are covariant but
Java generics are not: that is, <code>String[]</code> is a subtype of <code>Object[]</code>, but
<code>Stack&lt;String></code> is not a subtype of <code>Stack&lt;Object></code>.</p><h3 id=question-4-detect-cycle-in-a-linked-list>Question 4 Detect cycle in a linked list</h3><p>A singly-linked data structure is a data structure made up of nodes where

that you have a pointer to the first node of a singly-linked list data
structure:</p><ul><li>Determine whether a singly-linked data structure contains a cycle. You
may use only two pointers into the list (and no other variables). The
running time of your algorithm should be linear in the number of nodes

first node that participates in the cycle. you may use only a constant
number of pointers into the list (and no other variables). The running
time of your algorithm should be linear in the number of nodes in the
data structure.</li></ul><p>You may not modify the structure of the linked list.</p><p>Hint: maintain a tortoise pointer that advances one node per time step and
a hare pointer that advances two nodes per time step.</p><h3 id=question-5-clone-a-linked-structure-with-two-pointers-per-node>Question 5 Clone a linked structure with two pointers per node</h3><p>Suppose that you are given a reference to the first node of a linked
structure where each node has two pointers: one pointer to the next node
in the sequence (as in a standard singly-linked list) and one pointer to
an arbitrary node.</p><p>Design a linear-time algorithm to create a copy of the doubly-linked
structure. You may modify the original linked structure, but you must end
up with two copies of the original.</p><p>Hint: begin by inserting a new node x′ into the linked list immediately
after each original node x.</p><h2 id=elementary-sorts>Elementary Sorts</h2><h3 id=question-1-intersection-of-two-sets>Question 1 Intersection of two sets</h3><p>Given two arrays a[] and b[], each containing N distinct points in the
plane, design a subquadratic algorithm to determine how many points are
contained in both arrays.</p><p>Hint: shellsort.</p><h3 id=question-2-permutation>Question 2 Permutation</h3><p>Given two integer arrays of size N, design a subquadratic algorithm to
determine whether one is a permutation of the other. That is, do they
contain exactly the same entries but, possibly, in a different order.</p><p>Hint: sort both arrays.</p><h3 id=question-3-dutch-national-flag>Question 3 Dutch national flag</h3><p>Given an array of N buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble,
sort them by color. The allowed operations are:</p><ul><li>swap(i,j): swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j.</li><li>color(i): color of pebble in bucket i.</li></ul><p>The performance requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>At most N calls to color().</li><li>At most N calls to swap().</li><li>Constant extra space.</li></ul><h2 id=mergesort>Mergesort</h2><h3 id=question-1-merging-with-smaller-auxiliary-array>Question 1 Merging with smaller auxiliary array</h3><p>Suppose that the subarray a[0] to a[N-1] is sorted and the subarray a[N]
to a[2 * N-1] is sorted. How can you merge the two subarrays so that a[0]
to a[2 * N-1] is sorted using an auxiliary array of size N (instead of
2N)?</p><p>Hint: copy only the left half into the auxiliary array.</p><h3 id=question-2-counting-inversions>Question 2 Counting inversions</h3><p>An inversion in an array a[] is a pair of entries a[i] and a[j] such that
i &lt; j but a[i] > a[j]. Given an array, design a linearithmic algorithm to
count the number of inversions.</p><p>Hint: count while mergesorting.</p><h3 id=question-3-shuffling-a-linked-list>Question 3 Shuffling a linked list</h3><p>Given a singly-linked list containing N items, rearrange the items
uniformly at random. Your algorithm should consume a logarithmic (or
constant) amount of extra memory and run in time proportional to NlogN in
the worst case.</p><p>Hint: design a linear-time subroutine that can take two uniformly shuffled
linked lists of sizes N₁ and N₂ and combined them into a uniformly
shuffled linked lists of size N₁ + N₂.</p><h2 id=quicksort>Quicksort</h2><h3 id=question-1-nuts-and-bolts>Question 1 Nuts and bolts</h3><p>A disorganized carpenter has a mixed pile of N nuts and N bolts. The goal
is to find the corresponding pairs of nuts and bolts. Each nut fits
exactly one bolt and each bolt fits exactly one nut. By fitting a nut and
a bolt together, the carpenter can see which one is bigger (but the
carpenter cannot compare two nuts or two bolts directly). Design an
algorithm for the problem that uses NlogN compares (probabilistically).</p><p>Hint: modify the quicksort partitioning part of quicksort.</p><p>Remark: This research paper gives an algorithm that runs in N log⁴ N time
in the worst case.</p><h3 id=question-2-selection-in-two-sorted-arrays>Question 2 Selection in two sorted arrays</h3><p>Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[], of sizes N₁ and N₂, respectively,

min-oriented.</p><h3 id=question-2-randomized-priority-queue>Question 2 Randomized priority queue</h3><p>Describe how to add the methods sample() and delRandom() to our binary
heap implementation. The two methods return a key that is chosen uniformly
at random among the remaining keys, with the latter method also removing
that key. The sample() method should take constant time; the delRandom()
method should take logarithmic time. Do not worry about resizing the
underlying array.</p><h3 id=question-3-taxicab-numbers>Question 3 Taxicab numbers</h3><p>A taxicab number is an integer that can be expressed as the sum of two
