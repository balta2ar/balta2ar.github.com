Today, kids, we are going to download iTunes U course almost exclusively from
the command line.

<!-- more -->

## Why

The easiest way to do that is to use iTunes to download all that for you.
Unfortunately, while I have iPod/iPad in my home ecosystem, I don't have any
Mac computers. Thus, I'm running iTunes in a virtual machine on Windows.
Imagine my user experience from such combination. Pure pain and suffering.

There wouldn't be this post if it was all smooth. For unknown reasons my iTunes
doesn't save downloaded video files. I can see it's downloading them, I can
see the temp file growing, but when it's done, puff, I can't find the file
anywhere. Luckily, there is a solution. It is a pity but you still need iTunes
for a couple of steps.

## How

OK, let's do it. Say, you found an interesting course on iTunes U:

### Step 1. Subscribe to the course in iTunes

### Step 2. Copy course url

Click on any item in the course materials list and
select "Copy iTunes U URL".

NB: There is [iTunes U Course Manager](https://itunesu.itunes.apple.com/coursemanager/)
web page and I presume you might get the feed URL there (though I really doubt
you can). However, my country isn't enjoying Apple's favour.

### Step 3. Download the feed

```
wget -O list.xml https://p1-u.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/LZStudent.woa/ra/feed/CODBABB3ZC
```

### Step 4. Extract links and titles

The feed contains `feed/entry` items in the format as follows:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:itms="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/itunesu-1.0.dtd">
    <title type="text">Machine Learning</title>
    <subtitle type="text">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A real Caltech course...</subtitle>
    <updated>2013-06-12T00:19:12PDT</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html"
          href="https://p1-u.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/LZStudent.woa/ra/courses/CODBABB3ZC"/>
    <id>1/CODBABB3ZC</id>
    <itms:courseid>CODBABB3ZC</itms:courseid>
    <itms:auditUrl>https://itunesu.itunes.apple.com/audit/CODBABB3ZC</itms:auditUrl>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AC___Lecture 01 slides]]></summary>
        <link rel="enclosure" type="application/pdf"
              href="http://a1372.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/CobaltPublic/v4/35/56/6a/35566a02-1e0a-3db8-17e2-69be6445ba9b/208-5815754981465838988-ACsld01.pdf"
    length="300673"/>
    </entry>

...
```

It is very convenient to use [xmlstartlet](http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/doc/UG/xmlstarlet-ug.html)
to extract titles and links from the feed. Note, however, that xmlstartlet is
very picky to namespace (thanks to [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9025492/xmlstarlet-does-not-select-anything)
answer). Extraction command will look as follows:

```
xml sel -N x="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" -t -m //x:entry -v x:title -o "|" -v x:link/@href -n list.xml > fmt.txt
```

### Step 5. Download the course

Now all that is left is to read titles and links and
download them. I prefer to use [aria2c](http://aria2.sourceforge.net/)

```
IFS='|' && while read a b; do n=$a.${b##*.}; aria2c --allow-overwrite=false --auto-file-renaming=false -o $n $b; done < fmt.txt
```

`${b##*.}` is a command to get filename extension (see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/965053/extract-filename-and-extension-in-bash)
and [this](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion))
